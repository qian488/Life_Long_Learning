Q: Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? 
    Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing. 
A: There may be a race condition in `insert()`
    thread1: insert(k1, v1, &table[0], table[0])    thread2: insert(k2, v2, &table[0], table[0])
    e->key = k1;
    e->value = v1;
    e->next = table[0];
                                                    e->key = k2;
                                                    e->value = v2;
                                                    e->next = table[0];
    &table[0] = e; // table header point to e
                                                    &table[0] = e; // table header be overwritten by thread2
    // error: k1 missing
